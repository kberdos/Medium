                <p>
                    Slivers<br>
                    Of sharp tear drops <br>
                    They swim<br>
                    In an open sea of tragedy<br>
                    But don't cry too loud, since<br>
                    I can't hear you heart beating anymore<br>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The breeze<br>
                    Passes gently through the window<br>
                    A tremble down my spine<br>
                    It aches, it burns, it scares knowing you're not alive, so<br>
                    Don't let go, child<br>
                    Just let me hold you once and I'll fell you're mine<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the stars sink into the night<br>
                    It's only you who deserves their light, but<br>
                    You're leaving now, gone<br>
                    Oh, dear Lord I<br>
                    Need you to hear my prayers<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Send her my way!<br>
                    I'll chase her 'till the voilet moonlight fades'<br>
                    I'll travel far and wide<br>
                    Through every night and day through snow and hail<br>
                    We'll just smile<br>
                    You're like me, dear<br>
                    I've wanted nothing more than a gentle loving<br>
                    Kid since I was just five<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the stars sink into the night<br>
                    It's only you dear who deserves their light<br>
                    So, keep breathing slow, please<br>
                    Lord, send a sign<br>
                    I'll give you all my time<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Trade her for me!<br>
                    I'll be glad to sacrifice my fading days<br>
                    I'll crumble, I'll expire<br>
                    So long as she can live a precious innocent childhood<br>
                    It's so wrong how life<br>
                    Chooses to be only in<br>
                    Vile, rancid losers such as your dad<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'll be there with you<br>
                    Up in heaven holding true<br>
                    Just your little Hand wrapped around finger<br>
                    You're so strong!<br>
                    Esther my daugher, not this world<br>
                    This isn't the place for you<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Why rip her away from me<br>
                    I'm aching to lament this death with shriveling cries<br>
                    Her eyes<br>
                    Are such striking images of mine<br>
                    Fly<br>
                    Far away, please<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Time, it flies by<br>
                    But my time has expired 'Till I die<br>
                    I'm<br>
                    Gone
                </p>
