                <p>
                    Ineffectual me,<br>
                    Unmedicated ADHD,<br>
                    Can't sit still while writing poetry,<br>
                    Call me Jogging K. Rowling.<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Begins this way:<br>
                    A boy grew up in Maynard,<br>
                    Second smallest town<br>
                    Took a while to learn to say words,<br>
                    As his tongue twists in his mouth<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    He was phenomenal with aleph-null,<br>
                    Made math quickly his passion<br>
                    Geometric, slick assassin<br>
                    Filled with sugar that make him crackling<br>
                    He was cackling, passing stacks of classes<br>
                    Who would've had it that inside he was sad.<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Got distracted from math, so many slaps<br>
                    On his hands, scrapped so many<br>
                    Paths, this and that, no longer<br>
                    Enough to make it past<br>
                    He should find a different craft<br>
                    So he can stop being daft.<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ineffectual him.<br>
                    Ineffectual me.<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    But look, on the keys<br>
                    It's a five year old, Jeez<br>
                    Playing harmonies, no harm in these<br>
                    Had a teacher, she'd marvel at me<br>
                    "So proud, now do it faster,"<br>
                    So I played as she pleased.<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    It was years of perspiring,<br>
                    Pounding fists, expiring<br>
                    Reach higher, don't cry they'd say<br>
                    But inside, I'm dying, hey!<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Is this the pain that leads to pleasure,<br>
                    What's on the other side?<br>
                    Will I be the best if I'm trying to hide<br>
                    These bursting emotions inside?<br>
                    Am I flawed to feel obliged<br>
                    To let my inner thoughts fly?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ineffectual me,<br>
                    So un-directional, he.<br>
                    Sometimes I wonder why I tried so hard<br>
                    When the truth was so obvious,<br>
                    Swear to God I should've stopped and gripped<br>
                    The realization, the only realization...<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    That a bug is ineffectual in a storm<br>
                    Just as I am ineffectual in this world<br>
                    Take each of my qualities and watch, you'll see<br>
                    Another million copies<br>
                    One who speaks less choppy<br>
                    A whole heap of Steves<br>
                    Who can outdo me as they please,<br>
                    Oh, ineffectual me.<br>
                </p>
            </div>
            
        </main>
