                <p>
                    When I was about four,<br>
                    I wrapped pajama bottoms around my shoulders<br>
                    For warmth, and declared myself Canadian<br>
                    I was to set out into the arctic terrain<br>
                    In search for the mother of all the<br>
                    Geese that were invading my grandparents' lakehouse<br>
                    I assumed she'd be able to convince them to come home<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    In that moment,<br>
                    I, Kazzy<br>
                    Was undeniably me.<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    A young child always scrambling to dabble with<br>
                    Things wild, I just had to get a hand on every<br>
                    New smile, all while<br>
                    I never stopped pacing,<br>
                    I was a game of brain versus carpet,<br>
                    I couldn't stop it, <br>
                    Had to put a foot on each separatae spot, it<br>
                    Got my thoughts going<br>
                    One hundred miles per hour, that's the best way I can think<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    In ninth grade, I had a feeling<br>
                    That my ceiling was higher than my head<br>
                    I wanted to glide, take more strides<br>
                    So I went to my friend, and said<br>
                    "Show me something that makes your heart beat,"<br>
                    "Show me something that makes you glee,"<br>
                    And the nexy day he came back with a helmet and pair of skis<br>
                    We were waitless, I couldn't wait, this<br>
                    Was exactly what I wanted<br>
                    Carving snakes in the soft snow banks<br>
                    Bliss came back from long ago<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    In that moment,<br>
                    Floating down that mountain<br>
                    I, Kazuya<br>
                    Was undeniably me,<br>
                    Inspired to be free.<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Junior year of high school<br>
                    Our first presentation, another Powerpoint<br>
                    More hours, pointless boring nights<br>
                    Consecutively scrambling to make less words<br>
                    Rambly, I couldn't stand the agony<br>
                    Of monotony, it was often we would have to<br>
                    Sit and not fall asleep,<br>
                    But this time, I would be different,<br>
                    I slipped from the stitched quilt<br>
                    And set off the break the slideshow<br>
                    Well, I know, that with my flow<br>
                    I could entertain an audience<br>
                    Who stopped counting the broad cadence<br>
                    Of shaky, nervous voices<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    To present on the Shang Dynasty<br>
                    I thought I would try to be<br>
                    Something of a fly emcee<br>
                    So I got my camera and some stamina to<br>
                    Put words in lyrical order<br>
                    I soared through King Tang,<br>
                    His Shang Gang, and how mightily<br>
                    His horn rang<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Press play,<br>
                    Watch them smile,<br>
                    Watch them "ooh," and "aah,"<br>
                    Twelve straight hours of work for these two minutes<br>
                    Yet I wouldn't change a thing<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Because in those minutes<br>
                    I was limitless<br>
                    I was killing this<br>
                    I, Kaz,<br>
                    Was undeniably me.
                </p>
