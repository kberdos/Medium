            <p>My Portfolio is titled <mark>“Medium.”</mark> In it I want to explore the <mark>boundaries of creative writing</mark> by stepping outside some of the traditional forms I've worked with and seen. The inspiration for the portfolio stems from one of my pieces, <mark>“Duplexity,”</mark> where I had the idea of writing a poem that can be read <mark>forwards and backwards.</mark> While that poem was challenging to write and took many tries to get right, I found great pleasure in fiddling with the words until they fit. What results is a poem simplistic in diction, yet complex in structure. From its <mark>palindromic legibility</mark> alone, I found myself able to embed some deeper messages on relationships, hidden thoughts, and societal conventions essentially for free. </p>
            
            <p>From there, I took on a greater challenge in <mark>“Your Knight,”</mark> where I created a reversible and concrete poem, which added even more interesting challenges. It’s interesting to have heard multiple opinions from others on who or how many narrators there are; while I had these questions answered while writing the poem, <mark>I prefer to embrace the open-endedness that it sparks.</mark></p>
        
            <p>I strongly believe that <mark>poetry should not only be read, but also experienced in other ways.</mark> That’s why <mark>“Ineffectual Me”</mark> is a project I knew I had to include in this portfolio. I want to present a work that you can feel through my own voice, <mark>the trembles and cracks and change of tone, rhythms, etc.</mark> are all so important to an introspective piece. It’s a rant, it’s a rap, it’s one medium for me to let my creative juices and pent-up emotions free. To write slam poetry I really take a step away from the calculated, thought-intensive process that usually goes into my writing, and instead just try and capture my feelings on a page; <mark>the rhythm and rhymes escape my inner-conscience in a more abstract form, before I polish them.</mark></p>
            
            <p>On a similar note, <mark>“If you were a Rainstorm”</mark> is a poem I created for people to actually interact with their poetry in a concrete fashion. This is a poem, a character that <mark>fights back against your input.</mark> Your name is physically placed within the poem itself. As someone who <mark>loves programming and working with computers,</mark> I found it necessary to combine those passions with my creative writing in some capacity, so this work is my first attempt at joining the two. By experimenting with time and random number generation, I can make words appear to tremble as they leave the speaker's mouth. Through interaction, one can have <mark>multiple poems</mark> to experience from the same work.</p>
        
            <p>As a pianist, my favorite composer to play has always been Chopin. He’s the only composer I’ve encountered who can truly, beyond any doubt, make a piano sing. Perhaps Liszt could make more complicated and harmonic pieces, perhaps Beethoven broke more barriers, etc. etc. But nobody gave the piano a voice like Chopin. So, I took the first Chopin piece I learned, his famous Nocturne in E-flat, and meticulously mapped lyrics to the notes, many of which I had imagined all those years ago while first learning the piece. Truthfully, writing “over” such a monstrously phenomenal and timeless piece felt wrong in a sense, though through this work I feel that I have created my own personal layer on top of a piece of music that I already have deeply resonated with for so many years.</p>
        
            <p>And so, “Medium” is an intermediary between experimental and conventional genres, an amalgamation of my passions, curiosities, and challenges for myself. I can see myself expanding each piece into a much larger work or collection of works, so this small assembly could very well be the “stem cells” for my future creative endeavors.</p>
