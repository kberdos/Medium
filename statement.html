            <p>My Portfolio is titled <mark>“Medium.”</mark> In it I want to explore the <mark>boundaries of creative writing</mark> by stepping outside some of the traditional forms I've worked with and seen. The inspiration for the portfolio stems from one of my pieces, <mark>“Duplexity,”</mark> where I had the idea of writing a poem that can be read <mark>forwards and backwards.</mark> While that poem was challenging to write and took many tries to get right, I found great pleasure in fiddling with the words until they fit. What results is a poem simplistic in diction, yet complex in structure. From its <mark>palindromic legibility</mark> alone, I found myself able to embed some deeper messages on relationships, hidden thoughts, and societal conventions essentially for free. From there, I took on a greater challenge in <mark>“Your Knight,”</mark> where I created a reversible and concrete poem, which added even more interesting challenges. It’s interesting to have heard multiple opinions from others on who or how many narrators there are; while I had these questions answered while writing the poem, I prefer to embrace the open-endedness that it sparks. </p>
