            <p>My Portfolio is titled <mark>“Medium.”</mark> In it, I want to explore the <mark>boundaries of creative writing</mark> by stepping outside some of the traditional forms I’ve worked with and seen. The inspiration for the portfolio stems from one of my pieces, <mark>“Duplexity,”</mark> where I had the idea of writing a poem that can be read <mark>both forwards and backwards.</mark> While that poem was challenging to write and took many tries to get just right, I found great pleasure in fiddling with the words until they fit. What results is a poem <mark>simplistic in diction, yet complex in structure.</mark> From its <mark>palindromic legibility alone,</mark> I find myself able to embed some deeper messages on relationships, hidden thoughts, and societal conventions, <mark>essentially for free.</mark></p>
            
            <p>From there, I took on a greater challenge in <mark>“Your Knight,”</mark> where I created a <mark>reversible and concrete poem,</mark> which added even more interesting challenges. It’s fascinating to have heard <mark>multiple opinions from others on who or how many narrators there are;</mark> while I had these questions answered while writing the poem, I prefer to embrace the <mark>open-endedness</mark> that its structure sparks.</p>
        
            <p>I strongly believe that <mark>poetry should not only be read, but also experienced in other sensory ways.</mark> That’s why the pair of <mark>“Ineffectual Me”</mark> and <mark>“Undeniably Me”</mark> were so important for me to include in this portfolio. I want to present works through which <mark>you can feel my voice—-the trembles, cracks, change of tone, rhythms, etc.</mark> are all so important to introspective pieces like these. It’s a rant, it’s a rap, it’s one medium for me to <mark>let my creative juices and pent-up emotions free.</mark> To write slam poetry, I really take a step away from the calculated, thought-intensive process that usually goes into my writing, and instead just <mark>try and capture my feelings on a page;</mark> the rhythm and rhymes escape my inner-conscience in a more abstract form, before I polish them. </p>
            
            <p>On a similar note, <mark>“If you were a Rainstorm”</mark> is a poem I created for people to actually <mark>interact with their poetry</mark> in a concrete fashion. This is a poem where a <mark>narrator responds to your input.</mark> As someone who loves programming and working with computers, I found it necessary to <mark>combine those passions with my creative writing</mark> in some capacity, so this work is my first attempt at joining the two. Through interaction, one can have multiple poems to experience from the same work, which I also hope gives users the <mark>freedom to explore the various paths and endings.</mark> </p>
        
            <p>As a pianist, <mark>my favorite composer to listen to and play has always been Chopin.</mark> He’s the only composer I’ve encountered who can truly, beyond any doubt, <mark>make a piano sing.</mark> Perhaps Liszt could make more complicated and harmonic pieces, perhaps Beethoven broke more barriers, and so on. <mark>But nobody gave the piano a voice like Chopin.</mark> So, I took the first Chopin piece I learned, his famous <mark>Nocturne in E-flat,</mark> and meticulously mapped lyrics to the notes, many of which I had imagined all those years ago while first learning the piece. Almost on its own, this piece lays out a <mark>sentimental and beautifully tragic</mark> narrative in my mind, so I tried my best to express that as well as I could through my lyrics. The reader is encouraged to <mark>listen along to the lyrics and try to match the words with the melody.</mark> Truthfully, writing "over" such a monstrously phenomenal and timeless piece felt wrong in a way, though through this work I feel that I have created my own <mark>personal layer</mark> on top of a piece of music that I already have deeply resonated with for so many years. </p>
        
            <p>And so, “Medium” is an <mark>intermediary between experimental and conventional genres,</mark> an amalgamation of my passions, curiosities, and challenges for myself. While there is a <mark>prescribed order for the pieces to be experienced in</mark> layed out in the table of contents, I believe there should be <mark>no restrictions</mark> for my audience’s enjoyment of the pieces, so they can be <mark>accessed in any order.</mark> I can see myself expanding each piece into a much larger work or collection of works, so this small assembly could very well be the <mark>“stem cells”</mark> for my future creative endeavors. I hope you enjoy.</p>
